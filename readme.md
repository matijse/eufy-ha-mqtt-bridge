# :warning: No longer actively maintained

Since there are now better alternatives with more features, I decided to no longer actively develop this script. 

* For Home Assistant users, I recommend the integration by @fuatakgun: https://github.com/fuatakgun/eufy_security, which uses the library by @bropat
* Generic library with more features and active development by @bropat: https://github.com/bropat/eufy-security-client
* Small wrapper around this library, to access it via webscokets which can be used in many scenario's: https://github.com/bropat/eufy-security-ws

# Eufy Home Assistant MQTT Bridge

This script subscribes to push notifications of the Eufy Security app and publishes events via MQTT to Home Assistant.
When using auto discovery, it automatically creates a device with sensors within Home Assistant.

Uses the [eufy-node-client](https://github.com/JanLoebel/eufy-node-client) by JanLoebel and is heavily inspired on
its examples.

## Create a second Eufy account!

At the moment it is not possible to use an account with 2FA enabled. You should not use the same account here and in the
app, because when you log in at one app, sometimes you get logged out on other locations. I recommend creating a second
account (with a strong random generated password and no 2FA) and invite it to your Eufy account.

When you receive "Failed to request" errors when starting this script, you have logged in too many times and are
temporarily blocked. Wait a day and you'll be able to log in again.

## Home Assistant Core vs Home Assistant Add-on

This repo describes running via Docker alongside Home Assistant Core. See [below](#run-as-home-assistant-add-on)
for an option to run it as an Add-on.

## Supported devices

The following devices and features are supported. When a device of that type is detected, the sensors that are supported
are automatically discovered in Home Assistant.

Also, the Door Sensor (T8900) is supported, this generates a separate sensor, based on door open/closed events.

All push messages from all devices are logged, click [here](https://github.com/matijse/eufy-ha-mqtt-bridge/issues/7) to
help with adding support for new devices or message types that aren't supported yet.

## Setup

### Configuration

In the data directory, you will need to create a `config.yml` file with your credentials. You can copy this from
`config.example.yml`. It should contain the following contents:

```yaml
eufy:
  username: "your@email"
  password: "password"
mqtt:
  url: "mqtt://dockerhost:1883"
  username: "user"
  password: "password"
  keepalive: 60
home_assistant:
  off_delay: 5
```

Only the Eufy username and password and MQTT url are required. Also MQTT username and password when set at the broker.
The other options can be omitted, with the defaults shown above.

* MQTT keepalive: adjusts the keepalive interval for the MQTT connection. This is the maximum interval in seconds
  between messages to/from the MQTT broker. Set this higher when you encounter disconnects.
* Home Assistant `off_delay`: Sets the delay in seconds after which a motion/doorbell sensor is set back to "No motion"
  after motion is detected.  

### Data folder

The data folder contains the config, logs and a record of all push notifications (so new types of notifications can
be discovered). Mount this directory to a local folder. Replace `/path/to/local/data/folder` in the Docker setups
below with the location where you want to store this data.

### Connecting to MQTT

If you run your MQTT broker on the same host as this Docker image, it cannot simply connect to `localhost` from inside
this Docker image. In that case, add a line to add the correct IP for the Docker network inside the image as
`dockerhost`. You can then use `mqtt://dockerhost:1883` as the MQTT url. Otherwise, you can remove that line from the
example below.

### Run via Docker

Run the container, with a volume mapping to the local data directory, for example:

```shell
docker run \
   -d \
   --name eufy-bridge \
   -v /path/to/local/data/folder:/app/data \
   --add-host=dockerhost:`docker network inspect --format='{{range .IPAM.Config}}{{.Gateway}}{{end}}' bridge` \
   matijse/eufy-ha-mqtt-bridge
```

Or add it to a Docker Compose file:

```yaml
services:
  eufy-bridge:
    container_name: eufy-bridge
    image: matijse/eufy-ha-mqtt-bridge
    volumes:
      - /path/to/local/data/folder:/app/data
```

If for some reason the connection with MQTT is lost, all sensors will be marked Unavailable in Home Assistant. So I
recommend not auto-restarting the Docker image, but adding an automation to Home Assistant to notify yourself when a
sensor is Unavailable. This prevents your account from getting blocked when the script keeps restarting due to a bug...

### Run via npm

To run directly via npm:

1. Clone this repository
1. Create a `config.yml` file in the `data` folder, for contents see above.
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm run start` or `npm run dev` to see debug output.

### Run as Home Assistant Add-on

[MaxWinterstein](https://github.com/MaxWinterstein/) created a Home Assistant Add-on Repository containing an easy
installable version of this bridge. See [MaxWinterstein/homeassistant-addons](https://github.com/MaxWinterstein/homeassistant-addons)
for more information.

## Manually adding sensors

When you have automatic discovery via MQTT disabled, you can add the binary sensors manually via YAML configuration:

Replace `{device_sn}` by the serial number of the device, for example `T8140P0123456789`

Motion detected:

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: Camera motion detected
    device_class: motion
    state_topic: homeassistant/binary_sensor/eufy/{device_sn}_motion/state
    json_attributes_topic: homeassistant/binary_sensor/eufy/{device_sn}_motion/attributes
    payload_on: motion
    payload_off: clear
    off_delay: 5
```

Doorbell button pressed:

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: Doorbell button pressed
    device_class: motion
    state_topic: homeassistant/binary_sensor/eufy/{device_sn}_doorbell/state
    json_attributes_topic: homeassistant/binary_sensor/eufy/{device_sn}_doorbell/attributes
    payload_on: motion
    payload_off: clear
    off_delay: 5
```

Crying detected:

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: Crying detected
    device_class: sound
    state_topic: homeassistant/binary_sensor/eufy/{device_sn}_crying/state
    json_attributes_topic: homeassistant/binary_sensor/eufy/{device_sn}_crying/attributes
    payload_on: crying
    payload_off: clear
    off_delay: 5
```

Thumbnail of last event:

```yaml
camera:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: Camera - Last event
    topic: homeassistant/camera/eufy/{device_sn}_thumbnail
```
